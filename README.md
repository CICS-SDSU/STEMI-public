*Composite Visualization of Multivariate Patient Space. Labeling encodes variable category (font color) and the magnitude and shape of area coverage (font size and text placement). Dominant variables explicitly delineated as areas: Family History of CVD (magenta), Current Smoking (cyan), Former Smoking (light cyan), and Previous History of CVD (yellow).*


## Getting the Project Files

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the
